# 👋 Hi, I’m Huzaifa Saran

🎓 I'm a BS Software Engineering student at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Pakistan).

🌐 I'm passionate about Web and App development with a strong interest in **AI integration**, especially using tools like OpenAI, Groq, and LangChain.

🧠 I have solid experience with:
- Python (OOP, Tkinter, Turtle)
- Django & Django REST Framework
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- React (basic), REST APIs, and PostgreSQL
- AI/Chatbot integration & Telegram bot development

🚀 Currently learning:
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for microservice deployment
- System Design and Cloud-native development
- Face Recognition-based projects using Python & dlib

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on **full-stack web apps**, **AI-driven projects**, or **DevOps-involved systems**.
